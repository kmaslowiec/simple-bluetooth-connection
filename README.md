## For Developers

### Branch

For branch names I am using following template `issue_number/description`, example:
> 1/initial-project

Where:

- `issue_number` – number preceded by a hash character for a particular issue,
- `description` – up to author, "what has been done in this commit?" in few words, could be a name of the issue for
  issues with only one commit.

### Commit

To keep bidirectional history, each commit should be associated with the corresponding issue,
so the template is following `#issue_number description`, example:
> #1 initial project
